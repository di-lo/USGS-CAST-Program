Weed risk assessments evaluate introduced plants and identify and prohibit ones with potentially large ecological impact. Geographic origin is an important component of risk assessments because climate and habitat matching influence risk. However, if the origin is explicit in a species name this might also create implicit biases that could affect risk assessments’ accuracy. Here, we ask how an explicit description of geographic origin affects people’s perception of risk.
